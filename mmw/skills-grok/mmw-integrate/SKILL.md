description: Use when you need to resolve an in-progress git merge/rebase conflict. `/mmw-implement` hands off here when `mmw result integrate` stops, or an unfinished result branch must rebase onto the task branch.
---

The target is the current task branch. Stay in this worktree. Do not merge into the default branch.

A merge started by `mmw result integrate` is already in progress — resolve it; do not run that command again.

Rebase an unfinished result branch in that result worktree. This session stays on the task branch.

Before any write:

先确认当前仓库位置。判定从上到下，命中一行就停。

| 情况 | 怎么判断 | 你做什么 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 不在 git 仓库里 | `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` 失败 | 向用户索取目标仓库路径。拿到路径后进入该仓库，再重新判断 |
| 在主检出里 | `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-dir` 等于 `--git-common-dir` | 停下，请用户用当前宿主开一棵工作树再开会话 |
| 没有分支 | `git symbolic-ref --quiet --short HEAD` 为空 | 按上文已定的任务分支名运行 `git switch -c <完整任务分支名>` |
| 已有任务分支 | 上面都不成立 | 用当前分支 |


1. **See the current state** of the merge/rebase. Check git history, and the conflicting files.

2. **Find the primary sources** for each conflict. Understand deeply why each change was made, and what the original intent was. Read the commit messages, check the PRs, check original issues/tickets.

3. **Resolve each hunk.** Preserve both intents where possible. Where incompatible, pick the one matching the merge's stated goal and note the trade-off. Do **not** invent new behaviour. Always resolve; never `--abort`.

4. Discover the project's **automated checks** and run them — typically typecheck, then tests, then format. Fix anything the merge broke.

5. **Finish the merge/rebase.** Stage everything and commit. If rebasing, continue the rebase process until all commits are rebased.

If the stated goal cannot decide, stop and ask. Write the trade-off in the merge or rebase commit message. In an MMW repo, start the checks at `TESTING.md` when that file exists.
